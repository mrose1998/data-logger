Repository for the data logger I am working on for my job

Hi my name is Michala. I work as a Covid-19 Testing Assistant. I thought a useful project would be to create a small application that takes info from a CSV file and outputs min/max temps for a day. The data is auto generated into a CSV by a temperature logger with a probe. It is my hope to have a GUI made for my small piece of software by Monday (02/22/21).
